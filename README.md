# Statistical Pattern Recognition Module Coursework  
Analysis of holopelagic *Sargassum spp.* biomass composition using advanced statistical techniques.

## Overview  
This project explores the biomass composition of holopelagic *Sargassum spp.* — seaweed drifting in open ocean systems — with the goal of understanding how factors like processing method, seasonality and volcanic ash influence biomass structure and element content.

## Methods  
Key statistical techniques applied:  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – to reduce dimensionality and identify major variation drivers  
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** – to distinguish groups based on processing/seasonal categories  
- **Random Forest** – to model predictive relationships between biomass features and external factors
